# Cool APIs

The first application of my [30 in 30 challenge](http://www.github.com/msmichellegar/30-in-30), I thought I'd inspire myself with a showcase of interesting APIs. This is a static site documenting some of the more creative or unusual APIs I've found in my internet travels. To serve as a reference tool and discovery platform.

The site is pure frontend. I've taken the opportunity to experiment with the [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/) framework for the first time, making liberal use of the cards component. Apart from Materialize, I've just used basic HTML and SASS.

I'd love to make the site more interactive with an "I'm feeling lucky" button, or something to that effect.  Without that the site is pretty simple. But it was a useful mini-project for getting to grips with Materialize nonetheless.

Deployed to GitHub pages and live [here](http://msmichellegar.github.io/cool-apis).
